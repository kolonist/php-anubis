Implementation of "tweaked" version of Anubis block cipher. Cipher Block
Chaining (CBC) mode used to encrypt and decrypt data that are longer
than 16 octets.

ANUBIS is a block cipher designed by Vincent Rijmen and
Paulo S. L. M. Barreto that operates on data blocks of length 128 bits,
and uses keys of length 128 to 320 bits in steps of 32 bits. Really it's
just a variety of Rijndael cipher so it supposed to be as strong as original
Rijndael is. The authors claim the algorithm to be secure against a number
of attacks, including four-round differential and linear analysis, as well
as related-key, interpolation, boomerang, truncated differential, impossible
differential, and saturation attacks. Although many involutional components
can make a cipher more susceptible to distinguishing attacks exploiting the
cycle structure of permutations within the cipher, no attack strategy for
the Anubis cipher has been presented. Today only bruteforce attack can be
applied to this cipher.

ANUBIS is not (and will never be) patented. It may be used free of charge
for any purpose.
